  ## Description
As an avid traveller
I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data or internet connection
so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

This project is a simple budget tracker, built as a Progressive Web App. It uses Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

  ## Installation
  Use the deployed app here: <br>
  [Budget Tracker on Heroku](https://limitless-reef-05057.herokuapp.com/)
  <br><br>

  ## Usage
  When online, enter the transaction name and amount, then click either the "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" buttons. 
  The total amount at the top of the screen, as well as the line graph and the transaction table, will update accordingly.

  When offline, you may still enter transaction names, amounts, and click "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds." The transactions 
  will be stored locally and the total amount will be updated when you are back online.
